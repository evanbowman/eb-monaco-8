# EB-Monaco-8

An 8x8 pixel font inspired by the famous Monaco-9 monospaced font. I painstakingly revised Monaco-9 into a slightly smaller size, and expanded the font to include accented latin characters and the Cyrillic alphabet. I received several compliments on the font's neatness and readability at small sizes, after using the font in a few of my gameboy projects. If you need an 8x8 pixel font for a system that uses 8x8 tiles (e.g. gameboys), consider using this neat and highly readable font!

Currently, I'm distributing the font as a plain .png image. If you want a .ttf, just raise an issue on this repository and I'll be happy to commit one.
